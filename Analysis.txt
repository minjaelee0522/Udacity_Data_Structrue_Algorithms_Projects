Task0

To obtain this answer, I don't need to iterate because it requires first line and last line. These index are 1, -1.
So it is O(2), in resuut, O(1).












Task1


To obtain this answer, I need to iterate 2 times for loops. It is O(2n). And I applied add, set function. each fuctions are O(1). 
Task1 is O(2n) + O(1), in result, it is O(n). 







Task2



To obtain this answer, I need to iterate 1 time for loops and get dictionary keys function. It is O(n), O(1). 
And I applied max function, which is O(n) because it needs to check every key's value to obtain the number (key) with the longest time (value).
It is 2*O(n) + o(1). In result, answer is O(n).








Task3

To obtain this answer, first for loop O(n), first 'if' has slices in for loop is O(n), and 4'if' have slices in first 'if'. Sum of notation is O(n)*O(n)*O(4n)=O(4n^3).
And second for loop has sorted funtion, it is O(n + nlogn).
The third for loop has slice and append, it is O(n^2+1).  
Sum of notation is O(4n^3) + O(n + nlogn) + O(n^2 + 1), finallys O(n^3)











Task4


To obtain this answer, I need to iterate 4 times for loops. It is 4*O(n). I used 'not in', it accounts for O(n). And I applied 2 times set functions, 5 times append functions, and 1 time sorted function. 
set function is O(1) * 2, append function is also O(1) * 5, sorted function is O(nlogn). Sum of notations is 5*O(n) + 7*O(1) + O(nlogn), in result, answer is O(n).
