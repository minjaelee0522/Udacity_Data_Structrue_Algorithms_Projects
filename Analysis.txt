Task0

To obtain this answer, I don't need to iterate because it requires first line and last line. These index are 1, -1.
So it is O(2), in result, O(1).












Task1


To obtain this answer, I need to iterate 2 times for loops. It is O(2n). And I applied add, set function. each fuctions are O(1). 
Task1 is O(2n) + O(1), in result, it is O(n). 







Task2



To obtain this answer, I need to iterate 1 time for loops and get dictionary keys function. It is O(n), O(1). 
And I applied max function, which is O(n) because it needs to check every key's value to obtain the number (key) with the longest time (value).
It is 2*O(n) + o(1). In result, answer is O(n).








Task3

To obtain this answer, first for loop has append O(n+1).
And second for loop has sorted and set funtion, it is O(n + nlogn + 1).
The third for loop has append, it is O(n+1).  
Sum of notation is O(nlogn + 3n + 3), finallys O(nlogn)











Task4


To obtain this answer, I need to iterate 4 times for loops. It is 4*O(n). I used 'not in', it accounts for O(n). And I applied 2 times set functions, 5 times append functions, and 1 time sorted function. 
set function is O(1) * 2, append function is also O(1) * 5, sorted function is O(nlogn). Sum of notations is 5*O(n) + 7*O(1) + O(nlogn), in result, answer is O(nlogn).
